# Analyzing-Presidential-Debates-with-NLP
For my Natural Language Processing class, we were challenged to complete a final project utilizing our skills on any new data set. I decided to examine transcripts from the 2020 presidential debates, hoping to find a more objective way to analyze candidates' debate performance in a highly polarized political climate. While in the end I found more questions than answers, it was great practice for applying NLP tools like sentiment analysis and doc2vec to a highly relevant text. The project consists of data analysis and a write up discussing my motivations, processes, and conclusions.
